## Google Lighthouse

[Google Lighthouse][Google Lighthouse] is an open-source, automated tool for measuring the quality of web pages. Google Lighthouse audits performance, accessibility and search engine optimization of web pages.

### Performance

Audits for metrics like first paint and time to interactive to determine lag.

### Accessibility

Checks for common issues that may prevent users from accessing your content.

### Best Practices

Looks for everything from HTTPS usage to correct image aspect ratios.

### SEO 

Checks for best practices to ensure your site is discoverable.

### Installation

You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you have to:

### npx

Use the following command 

```sh
npm i
cd my-app
npm start
```
